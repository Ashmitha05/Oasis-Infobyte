## TASK 1:
## 📖 Project Overview

The **Online Reservation System** is a Java-based application designed to simplify and digitalize the reservation process. The system provides users with an intuitive interface to reserve tickets by securely logging in and accessing the system. It stores data in a centralized database, enabling authorized access and efficient management of booking details.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary aim of this project is to:
- Digitize the reservation process
- Enable secure and centralized data storage
- Make the booking process user-friendly and efficient
- Reduce manual effort and errors

---

## 🧩 Modules

### 🔐 1. Login Form
- Every user must enter valid credentials (Login ID and Password).
- Upon successful login, users gain access to the main system.
- Ensures secure access to authorized users only.

### 🧾 2. Reservation System
- Allows users to make reservations with necessary details.
- Collects essential inputs like name, source, destination, date of journey, and seat number.
- Validates inputs and confirms booking after submission.
- Stores all booking data in a central database.

## TASK 2
# 💳 ATM Interface (Console-Based Java Project)

This project is **Task 2** of my Java Development Internship at **Oasis Infobyte**.  
It is a **console-based ATM simulation system** developed using **core Java** concepts. The goal of this project is to build a simple, interactive, and user-friendly interface that allows users to perform essential banking operations directly through the terminal.

## 📌 Project Overview

In the real world, ATMs are everywhere, and this project replicates the basic functions of an ATM through Java programming. The system is designed with an emphasis on **object-oriented programming**, and is divided into **five different Java classes** to separate concerns and keep the code modular.

When the system starts, users are prompted to enter their **User ID** and **PIN**. After successful login, the ATM menu is displayed, offering the user several banking functionalities.

## 🔧 Functionalities

Once the user logs in, the following operations can be performed:

- **Transaction History**  
  Displays a list of all the past transactions (withdrawals, deposits, transfers) done by the user during the session.

- **Withdraw**  
  Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount from their account, provided sufficient balance is available.

- **Deposit**  
  Enables the user to deposit money into their account, updating their current balance accordingly.

- **Transfer**  
  Lets the user transfer money to another user's account, simulating a basic peer-to-peer transaction.

- **Quit**  
  Ends the session and exits the ATM interface.

## 🧠 Key Highlights

- Designed with a focus on **user experience** through clear prompts and logical flow.
- Clean separation of concerns using multiple Java classes for better maintainability.
- Demonstrates the use of **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **data handling** in Java.
- Reinforces core programming concepts like conditionals, loops, methods, arrays/lists, and string operations.
- Handles edge cases such as insufficient balance, invalid inputs, and incorrect login details.

## 🧩 Project Structure

The program is divided into five Java classes, each with its own responsibility:

1. **Main Class** – Entry point of the program; handles login and navigation.
2. **Account Class** – Manages user data, including balance and transaction history.
3. **Transaction Class** – Stores and processes transaction data (deposit, withdraw, transfer).
4. **ATMOperations Class** – Contains the logic for performing operations like withdraw, deposit, etc.
5. **User Class** – Handles user authentication and account linkage.

## 🎓 What I Learned

Working on this project has helped me:

- Gain confidence in writing **modular, readable code** in Java.
- Practice **real-world logic building** using core Java constructs.
- Understand the importance of **user input validation** and error handling.
- Improve my ability to break down a large problem into smaller, manageable components.
